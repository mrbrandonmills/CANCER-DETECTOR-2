    "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY": "**Recommendation: Avoid regular consumption.** While Cheez-It Original won't immediately harm you, it's a highly processed snack loaded with concerning additives that have no place in a health-conscious diet. The combination of artificial dyes (Yellow 5 & 6), the preservative TBHQ, high fructose corn syrup, and inflammatory vegetable oils creates a product that prioritizes shelf-life and addictive taste over consumer health. Kellogg's has faced multiple controversies over ingredient transparency and marketing practices. For occasional consumption, the risk is minimal, but there are significantly cleaner alternatives that deliver similar satisfaction without the chemical cocktail.",
    "2. THE COMPANY BEHIND IT": "**Ownership Chain**: Kellanova (spun off from Kellogg Company in 2023) \u2192 Cheez-It brand\n\n**Corporate History & Controversies**:\n- Kellogg's has faced multiple lawsuits over false health claims, including a $5 million settlement in 2019 for misleading \"lightly sweetened\" claims on Frosted Mini-Wheats\n- 2021 strike involving 1,400 workers over working conditions and benefits lasted 11 weeks\n- Repeated criticism for marketing sugary cereals to children despite health pledges\n\n**Lobbying & Political Influence**:\n- Kellogg's spent $570,000 on federal lobbying in 2022, primarily opposing GMO labeling requirements and nutrition regulations\n- Member of Grocery Manufacturers Association, which has fought against ingredient transparency initiatives\n\n**Recent Legal Issues**:\n- 2022: Class action lawsuit over \"Strawberry\" Pop-Tarts containing no actual strawberries\n- 2021: FTC investigation into environmental claims on packaging\n- Multiple ongoing cases regarding \"natural\" labeling on products containing synthetic ingredients\n\n**Ethics Assessment**: Below average. Prioritizes profit margins over ingredient quality and has a pattern of misleading marketing practices.",
    "3. INGREDIENT DEEP DIVE": "**TBHQ (Tertiary Butylhydroquinone)**\n- *Purpose*: Synthetic antioxidant preservative to prevent oil rancidity\n- *Health Concerns*: Studies link TBHQ to immune system dysfunction and potential carcinogenic effects. Research published in *Environmental Health Perspectives* (2019) found TBHQ may impair immune response to influenza vaccines\n- *Global Status*: Banned in Japan, heavily restricted in EU (maximum 200mg/kg). US allows up to 200ppm\n- *Why US allows it*: FDA grandfathered it in 1972 before modern safety testing standards\n\n**Yellow 5 & Yellow 6 (Tartrazine & Sunset Yellow)**\n- *Purpose*: Artificial coloring to create orange cheese appearance\n- *Health Concerns*: Linked to hyperactivity in children (Southampton Study, 2007), allergic reactions, and potential carcinogenic compounds. European Food Safety Authority requires warning labels\n- *Global Status*: Requires warning labels in EU, banned in Norway and Austria for children's products\n- *Why US allows it*: FDA maintains \"insufficient evidence\" standard despite European precautionary approach\n\n**High Fructose Corn Syrup**\n- *Purpose*: Sweetener and flavor enhancer\n- *Health Concerns*: Princeton University studies (2010) linked HFCS to obesity and metabolic dysfunction more than regular sugar\n- *Global Status*: Heavily restricted in EU due to production quotas, widely used in US\n- *Why US allows it*: Corn industry lobbying and agricultural subsidies make it cheaper than alternatives",
    "4. SUPPLY CHAIN INVESTIGATION": "**Wheat Sourcing**: Primarily from US Midwest industrial farms using conventional pesticide-heavy methods. Likely suppliers include Cargill and ADM, both with documented environmental violations.\n\n**Vegetable Oil**: Likely soybean/canola oil from industrial monoculture farms. These crops are heavily treated with glyphosate and contribute to soil depletion.\n\n**Cheese**: Processed cheese powder likely sourced from factory farms with poor animal welfare standards. No transparency provided on dairy sourcing practices.\n\n**Labor Concerns**: 2021 Kellogg's strike highlighted mandatory overtime, 12-hour shifts, and two-tier wage systems. Production facilities in Battle Creek, MI and other locations have faced OSHA violations.\n\n**Environmental Impact**: High carbon footprint due to processed ingredients, excessive packaging, and industrial agriculture dependencies. No meaningful sustainability initiatives disclosed.",
    "5. REGULATORY HISTORY": "**FDA Actions**: \n- No specific warning letters for Cheez-Its found in public records\n- Kellogg's received FDA warning letter in 2010 for overstating health benefits on Frosted Mini-Wheats\n\n**Product Recalls**: \n- 2018: Cheez-It Grooves recalled due to undeclared sesame allergens\n- 2020: Limited recall of Cheez-It Snap'd due to potential plastic contamination\n\n**FTC Actions**:\n- 2019: Kellogg's paid $5 million settlement for deceptive health claims across product lines\n- Ongoing monitoring of \"natural\" claims on various Kellogg's products\n\n**State Actions**: California's Proposition 65 requires warning labels for products containing chemicals that may cause cancer - Cheez-Its sold in CA include these warnings for acrylamide content.",
    "6. BETTER ALTERNATIVES": "**1. Simple Mills Almond Flour Crackers**\n- *Why better*: Clean ingredient list (almond flour, seeds, sea salt), no artificial additives, higher protein\n- *Availability*: Target, Whole Foods, Amazon\n- *Price*: ~$1.50 more per serving but significantly more nutritious\n\n**2. Mary's Gone Crackers Real Thin Crackers**\n- *Why better*: Organic, gluten-free, made with whole seeds and grains, no synthetic preservatives\n- *Availability*: Most grocery stores, Costco\n- *Price*: Comparable per serving\n\n**3.

Homemade Alternative**\n- *Recipe*: Almond flour + real aged cheddar + sea salt + olive oil\n- *Why better*: Complete control over ingredients, no preservatives needed, fresher taste\n- *Cost*: Significantly cheaper per serving when made in batches\n\n**5.
